<h2>Wine Quality Analysis</h2>
<h3>Obervations: <br>

<br>

Analyzed fixed acidity, violatile acidity and cirtic acid.

Analyzed acids and their Quality.

The mean and median are close to each other and the differences between is very small.

The representative acid for the quality is as follows:

The mean value of the fixed acidity would be 6.854

The mean value of the volatile acidity would be 0.2782

The mean value of citric acid would be 0.3341

The quality would be 6

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<h3>
From the given data, we can use simple visualisations to get a sense of how data are distributed.
 <br>

I have used various measures of central tendency such as mean, median and mode to represent a group of observations.
<br> <br>
The type of central tendency measure to use depends on the type and the distribution of the data.
