  Descriptive Statistics Case Study Project
</h1>
<h3>
  Observations:
  id of the Employees <br> <br>
  Their respective Groups and Salaries <br> <br>
  Their healthy eating and Active lifestyle <br> <br>
  A scatter plot of employee age and employee salary, healthy_eating and active lifestyle, health eating and salary <br> <br>
  A count plot of groups <br> <br>
  A histogram of employee salary <br> <br>
</h3>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<h3>
  1.The only employee seemingly facing a discrepancy in salary as compared to healthy_eating is employee who is having id = 26. <br> <br>
  2.The employee with id having 26 has a salary of 700. <br> <br>
  3.From the given data, we can use simple visualisations to get a sense of how data are distributed. <br> <br>
  4.I can conduct preliminary analyses simply by subsetting data sets using well thought out thresholds and conditions.
